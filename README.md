# Rainbow Keyboard

## Overview 
Rainbow Keyboard is simple desktop typing application that makes typing fun. Once the user clicks the start button, writing prompts are appended to the page for the user to type. Once the answer is submitted with a click of the enter key, a new prompt takes the place of the old one. The fun audio and constanly changing colors as the user types, make this an exciting game to play.

## Design and Tech
The design of this website was created solely with CSS and HTML. Because of the nature of this being a desktop game run through the use of a keyboard, I did not bother to make this application mobile responsive. All the game logic and onclick/keyup/keydown commands were created through vanilla javaScript as an attempt to deepen my knowledge of writing pure JS without JQuery. Here is screenshot of what the game looks like:
